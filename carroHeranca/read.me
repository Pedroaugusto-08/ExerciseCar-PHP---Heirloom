--Project "carroHeranca" made in PHP with heirloom method--

I did this exercise using a heirloom on the class "Veiculo", it is the mother class, and
applied on the other classes the functions of Veiculo;
I used the extends to catch the characteristics and added/arrenged inside functions for each
inherited class;
To finish, I used the protecteds and privates variables too, was used the protected for pass
the characteristics of mother class to inherited classes, because this is what the protected do, he
allows the inherited classes access the functions of the mother class, and used the private to
that the function was used just on the especific inherited class.
